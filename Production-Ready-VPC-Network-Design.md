Production-ready VPC network design that supports Dev, Stage, Prod, and shared services (monitoring/logging) environments ‚Äî with a solid tagging strategy to support governance, cost tracking, security, and automation.

**VPC Network Design for Dev, Stage, Prod, and Shared Services**

Environment isolation: Separate VPCs or logically separated subnets per environment

Multi-AZ deployment: High availability and fault tolerance

Centralized logging and monitoring (VPC peering or centralized shared VPC)

Tagging strategy: To support security, billing, automation, and management

üåê 1. Network Layout

**Option A: Single VPC per environment**

- vpc-dev, vpc-stage, vpc-prod, and vpc-monitoring
- Useful for strict isolation, easier IAM/SCP enforcement
- VPC Peering or Transit Gateway used for centralized access/logging

**Option B: One VPC, environment isolation via subnets and naming**
- Easier to manage for smaller orgs
- Use subnet CIDR ranges to separate environments

**CIDR Design**

**VPC/Subnet	              CIDR Block	    AZ Example**

vpc-dev	                  10.0.0.0/16	    AZ-a, AZ-b
‚îú‚îÄ public-subnet-a	      10.0.1.0/24	    AZ-a
‚îú‚îÄ public-subnet-b	      10.0.2.0/24	    AZ-b
‚îú‚îÄ private-app-subnet-a	  10.0.11.0/24	  AZ-a
‚îú‚îÄ private-app-subnet-b	  10.0.12.0/24	  AZ-b
‚îî‚îÄ private-db-subnet-a/b	10.0.21.0/24	  AZ-a/b

Repeat similarly for stage (10.1.0.0/16), prod (10.2.0.0/16), and monitoring (10.3.0.0/16)

**Key Components per Environment**

 **Component	                    Description**
- VPC	                          Isolated per environment or shared with subnet-level isolation
- NAT Gateway	                  One per AZ for HA, or use single NAT (cost tradeoff)
- Internet Gateway	            For public subnet access
- Subnets	                      Public (for ALB/Bastion), Private App, Private DB
- Route Tables	                Separate route tables for public/private per AZ
- Security Groups	              Allow minimal required traffic; layered with NACLs as needed
- VPC Endpoints	                Use S3, DynamoDB endpoints to reduce NAT usage & increase security
- CloudWatchAgent/FluentBit    	Installed on nodes to forward logs/metrics
- Centralized Logging VPC	      Hosts ELK stack, Prometheus, or CloudWatch destination

**Security Considerations**

- Use AWS WAF and Shield on public-facing ALB
- Use IAM roles and least privilege for apps and services
- Encrypt all data at rest and in transit (EBS, RDS, S3 with KMS)
- Enable VPC flow logs and route to centralized logging VPC
- Private subnets have no IGW access, outbound via NAT only

**Tagging Strategy**

A consistent tagging strategy helps with cost allocation, security audits, automation, and resource governance.

 **Tag Key	              Example                 Value	Description**
- Environment	          dev, stage, prod	      Critical for segmentation
- Project	              website-backend	        Group resources by app/service
- Owner	                sri@example.com	        Accountable person or team
- Department	          Engineering, Finance	  Organizational context
- Terraform	            true	                  Helps identify IaC-managed resources
- CostCenter          	CC-00123	              Billing and chargeback
- Compliance	          pci, gdpr	              For regulated workloads
- Purpose	              app-server, db, lb	    Useful for cleanup and access policies
- Backup	               daily, none	          To enforce backup policies via automation

**Enforce tagging via:**

- AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- AWS Config + Rules
- Terraform default_tags block

**Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CDK)**

- Create separate modules: vpc, subnet, route, nat_gateway, alb, ec2, eks, rds
- Use input variables like env = "dev" to dynamically provision per environment
- Store remote state per environment (e.g., in S3 bucket with folders dev/, stage/, prod/)

**Monitoring + Logging Design**

  Component                  	Usage
- CloudWatch	                Metrics, Logs, Alarms for AWS services
- Fluent Bit	                Stream app logs from EC2/EKS to CloudWatch or ELK
- Prometheus + Grafana	      Custom app and infra monitoring
- AWS OpenSearch/ELK	        Centralized log search + alerting
- SNS or Slack Alerts	        For alert distribution
- X-Ray/Jaeger	              Tracing for microservices

**Enhancements**

- Use Transit Gateway instead of peering for large orgs
- Use Service Catalog to templatize VPCs
- Deploy Bastion Hosts via SSM Session Manager for auditability
- Enable GuardDuty, Config, Security Hub for security posture
